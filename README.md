# soundRTS Python3 version
Hello. This is an experimental fork which attempts to port soundRTS to python3
Currently the game runs from source, however I could only test on windows
## setup 
you will need:
* python 3.7 I've tested on python 3.7.4
* pygame
* pywin32
Alternatively you can run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running from source

```
python soundrts.py
```

## todo
* ensuring all tests pass, currently only 8 out of 83 fail
* The code has been ported with future, therefore some errors still need to be spotted
* Building an executable for the game
