Introduction
------------

This guide explains how to install a public server. A public server allows any player to create games.

Metaserver
----------------

The server should be automatically included in the servers list (also known as: metaserver).


Options
----------------

The following options are available in SoundRTS.ini.

Note that SoundRTS.ini is eventually created when the server or the client is started for the first time.

require_humans
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Default value: 0

If require_humans is set to 1, the server won't let the game creator invite computers until at least two human players are registered.

Only public servers are affected by this option.
